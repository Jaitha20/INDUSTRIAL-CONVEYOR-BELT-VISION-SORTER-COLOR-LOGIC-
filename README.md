# INDUSTRIAL-CONVEYOR-BELT-VISION-SORTER-COLOR-LOGIC-
This code simulates a complete industrial conveyor vision sorter by generating virtual camera images, classifying objects using pixel-level color dominance, scheduling sorting based on conveyor physics, detecting latency-based failures, and reporting performance locally and to the cloud.
